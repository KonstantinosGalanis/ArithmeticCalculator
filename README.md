# ArithmeticCalculator

This is an Arithmetic Calculator implemented in java using binary trees to calculate arithmetic expressions.

# Features 

This program  that evaluates any complex arithmetic expression which may contain:
1. Parentheses: indicate the priority of actions.
2. The symbols of operations (binary operators):
    -●  + (addition), (eg 3.3 + 2.2)
    ●  - (subtraction), (eg 3.3 - 2.2)
    ●  x or * (multiplication), (eg 3.3 x 2.2 or 3.3 * 2.2)
    ●  / (division), (eg 3.3 / 2.2)
    ●  ^ (raise to power), (eg 3.3^2.2)
4. Positive numbers (integer or floating point): All calculations are done
between floating point numbers.
5. Space characters ([ \t]) between parentheses, operators and numbers.
An example of a complex numerical expression is the following:
